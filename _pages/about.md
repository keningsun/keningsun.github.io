I am a master student at Northwestern University, Evanston, IL.
 
My research interests focus on transportation system analysis, particularly in travel behavior analysis and infrastructure network analysis. Moreover, I am fascinated with using the emerging technology like machine learning and big data to figure out the solutions for transportation problems.

Programming Language: Python, MATLAB, C, Javascript, R
